# Mouse-Like Agillity From A Touchpad!

## How To Use
Whenever the touchpad is touched, this macro will map the keyboard keys `j`, `k`, and `l` to the mouse buttons `left`, `middle`, and `right` respectively. 
This allows your right hand to press mouse buttons while controlling the touchpad with its thumb, allowing applications that require the use of a mouse to be operated from the touchpad. Examples of such applications include Solidworks, blender, and games like Minecraft or Fortnite.

## When To Use
When you need a mouse but do not have one near you right now.
